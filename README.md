# Google Analytics SpotApp

SpotApps are ThoughtSpot’s out-of-the-box solution templates built for specific use cases and data sources. They utilize ThoughtSpot Modeling Language (TML) Blocks, which are pre-built pieces of code that are easy to download and implement directly from the product.

The Google Analytics SpotApp mimics the Google Analytics data model. When deployed, it creates several Worksheets, Answers, and Liveboards based on your Google Analytics data in your cloud data warehouse.

Use the Google Analytics SpotApp to analyze data about customer engagement with your website and any ads on the website. Understand how people are using the website, and track the number of clicks and impressions generated by ads on the website.

## Prerequisites

Before you can deploy the Google Analytics SpotApp, you must complete the following prerequisites:

- **Review Required Data**: Examine the required tables and columns for the SpotApp.
- **Ensure Column Compatibility**: Ensure that your columns match the required column type listed in the schema for your SpotApp.
- **Sync Data**: Synchronize all tables and columns from Google Analytics to your cloud data warehouse. While you can choose to sync only the required tables and columns, ThoughtSpot recommends syncing all tables and columns from Google Analytics to ensure comprehensive data availability. This includes Google Analytics’s out-of-the-box columns or any custom columns you are using.
- **Collaborate on Data Movement**: If you are using an ETL/ELT tool or working with another team within your organization, sync all columns from the tables listed in the SpotApp.
- **Obtain Credentials**: Obtain credentials and SYSADMIN privileges to connect to your cloud data warehouse. The warehouse must contain the data ThoughtSpot will use to create Answers, Liveboards, and Worksheets. Refer to the connection reference for your cloud data warehouse for detailed information about required credentials.
- **Unique Connection Name**: Each new SpotApp connection name must be unique.
- **Administrator Access to Google Analytics**: Maintain administrator access to manage Google Analytics.
- **Access to Google Analytics Tables**: Ensure access to the following Google Analytics tables in your cloud data warehouse:
  - `ga_ad_analytics`
  - `ga_traffic_source`
  - `ga_geo_audience`
  - `ga_page_behaviour`
  - `ga_site_statistics`

### Run SQL Commands

Execute the necessary SQL commands in your cloud data warehouse to standardize data types and column names. Modify the code as necessary for your specific cloud data warehouse.

1. Log into your ThoughtSpot instance and create an Embrace connection to all of the relevant views.
2. Import the TML for the worksheets and verify that it has all been imported without any errors.
3. Import the TML for the pinboard and verify that it has all been imported without any errors.
4. You are ready to start searching your Databricks data!
